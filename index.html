    <p class="intro">My life has taken tons of twists and turns over the years. I have been a scientist, a map maker, a cook, a farmer, and a fundraiser. I have lived in the woods and spent my days harvesting wild herbs and keeping the forest safe from fire. I have lived in the city and navigated the rat race of urban life. I play roller derby, read tarot cards, make herbal medicine, and spend time with my dog and my sweet person.</p>

            <h2>Lizards?</h2>
            
            <p class="lizard">Yes. Lizards. Back around the dawn of time, when I was in college, I studied a species of small lizard named <i>Carlia rhomboidalis. C. rhomboidalis</i> like to run around in the leaf litter in the forests of Queensland Australia. I studied how they were adapting physically or phenotypically as well as genetically to their environment over time. What are your top favorite lizards? Mine are -  </p>

                <h2>Roller Derby!</h2>
                <p class="derby">In 2015, I got a job with the Rose City Rollers as the Marketing and Development Manager. It seemed like a good idea to start skating so that I could present an authentic view of the sport that I was raising money for and awareness about. I started Derby 101 in November of 2015 and have been skating ever since. I skate with the Rose City Roller Wreckers, the Willamette Kidney Thieves, and am a co-founder of Jewish Roller Derby</p>
