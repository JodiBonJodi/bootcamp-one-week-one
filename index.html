        <h2>Lizards?</h2>
        
        <p class="lizard">Yes. Lizards. Back around the dawn of time, when I was in college, I studied a species of small lizard named Carlia rhomboidalis. C. rhomboidalis likes to run around in the leaf litter in the forests of Queensland Australia. I studied how they were adapting physically or phenotypically as well as genetically to their environment over time. </p>

        <h2>Roller Derby!</h2>
        <p class="derby">In 2015, I got a job with the Rose City Rollers as the Marketing and Development Manager. It seemed like a good idea to start skating so that I could present an authentic view of the sport that I was raising money for and awareness about. I started Derby 101 in November of 2015 and have been skating ever since. I skate with the Rose City Roller Wreckers, the Willamette Kidney Thieves, and am a co-founder of Jewish Roller Derby</p>
